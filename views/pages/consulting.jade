    To help bootstrapping [transloadit][], I take on a limited amount of
    consulting work which consists of:

    * Advising on the architecture and code base of node.js apps
    * Bringing teams up to speed with node.js and best practices
    * Small and highly focused development projects (1-2 weeks maximum)
    * Improvements to any of my npm modules / writing new modules

    Generally speaking, I can help with most problems related to writing and
    running node.js applications.
