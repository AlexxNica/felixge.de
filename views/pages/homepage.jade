    Hi, I run a small consultancy in Berlin called [debuggable][]. We bootstrap
    a web service named [transloadit][].

    [debuggable]: http://debuggable.com/
    [transloadit]: https://transloadit.com/

    I am also a long time [node.js][] core contributor, and sometimes available for
    [consulting][].

    [node.js]: http://nodejs.org/

    ## Writing

    So far I've been writing over [here][old-blog], but expect new articles
    to show up on this site soon.
