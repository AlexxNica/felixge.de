# About

Hi, I am Felix Geisend√∂rfer, a programmer and entrepreneur living in Berlin, Germany.

I work at [transloadit.com](http://transloadit.com/),
a small, bootstrapped and profitable SaaS business that I co-founded in 2009.

A lot of my time is spend on [open source](/open-source), and I was an active contributor in
the early development of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

More recently, I helped to start a movement around programming flying
robots with JavaScript called [NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com/).

As of late, [go](http://golang.org/) has become my new language of choice. You
should check it out, it's amazing.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/felixge) and
[github](https://github.com/felixge), or [contact me](/contact) directly.
