# Contact

My primary e-mail is [felix@transloadit.com](mailto:felix@transloadit.com).

I get a lot of e-mail, so for some stuff I prefer other channels:

* Github issues for my open source projects.
* [felix@nodecopter.com](mailto:felix@nodecopter.com) for nodecopter stuff.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/felixge) for quick questions.

Generally speaking, I answer all e-mails, but usually with a delay of a few
days.
